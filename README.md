# mesoimg: mesoscopic imaging system for Raspberri Pi
Mesoimg covers camera control and streaming acquisition for a custom raspberry-pi based mesoscope for cortical imaging. 
It makes heavy use of multithreading, multiprocessing, and interprocess communication (via zeromq). This project is no longer in development/use, but I'll add some documentation soon in case someone finds it useful.
